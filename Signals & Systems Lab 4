%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% function [xf,w]=fourierseries(x,t0,n)
% symbolic Fourier series computation
% Inputs:
%   x - time domain signal
%   t0 - period of the signal
%   n - number of terms in Fourier series
% Outputs
%  xf - Fourier series coefficients
%  w - harmonic frequencies
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

function [xf,w] = fourierseries(x,t0,n) % opens new function fourierseries with input t0, x, n and output w, xf

syms t  % creates scalar variable t
for k=1:n   %creates for loop that increments from 1 to n
    x1(k) = int(x*exp(-j*2*pi*(k-1)*t/t0),t,-t0/2,t0/2)/t0; % creates array of Fourier coefficients
    xf(k) = subs(x1(k)); % creates array of coefficients using symbolic substitution function.
    w(k) = (k-1)*2*pi/t0; % creates array of frequencies using 2*pi*k/T equation.
